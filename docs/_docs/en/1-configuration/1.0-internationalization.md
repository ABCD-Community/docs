**ABCD** allows working in different dialog languages. Each language has its set of messages and labels defined in a sub-folder placed in the databases folder, whose name will correspond to the code with which the language is identified in the **lang.tab** file :

```
        in=English
        es=Spanish
        fr=French
        pt=Portuguese
```

The active language is set in the **config.php** through the **$lang** parameter whose value must correspond to a code from those existing in the **lang.tab table**

ex:

```
        $lang="en";
```
 It will enable the home page in Spanish and the menu to change the language will be displayed

If the installation contemplates [multiple database folders](http://abcdwiki.net/Carpetas_con_las_bases_de_datos) , the parameter **$msg_path** of **config.php** allows to define a single path for access to the message files, regardless of the selected database folder. The database folders may not have the **lang** subfolder since it will be located through the path indicated in **$msg_path** .

In addition to the active languages, there is a folder with virtual language **00** , which corresponds to the universe of messages recognized by ABCD. If an option is created or modified, the corresponding labels and messages will be added in language **00 .** In this way, if a message has not been translated into a specific language, it will be taken from the **000** folder .

To manage the dialog language, the scripts located in **central/lang** are used .

### Create a new dialog language

1. Copy the **00** folder and rename it with the code to use for the new language
2. Translate to the corresponding language
3. Add the new language to the new language lang.tab **table**
4. Add the new language to the **lang.tab** table of existing languages

To translate the new messaging you can use **Translate Messages and Labels** within the ABCD **Administration options.** You can also use a text file editor taking into account that you should not alter under any circumstances the amount that is displayed before the **=** sign of the table, since this value represents the internal code with which the message is referenced in the scripts. required.
