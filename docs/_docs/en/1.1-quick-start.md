ABCD is an acronym to designate a set of tools for the Automation of Libraries and **D** **ocumentation** **C** entres **.** This acronym is maintained in French: Automation des **B** ibliothèques et **C** **entros** de **D** ocumentacion and in Portuguese: **A** utomatização das **B** ibliotecas e dos **C** entros de **D** ocumentação. **Even in other non-Latin languages** with slight but acceptable variations, for example, in Dutch: Automatisering van **B** ibliotheken en **C** entra voor**Documentation** , where the acronym is also maintained.

The name itself expresses the ambition of the product: not only to provide automation functions for 'classic' libraries, but also for other information providers such as documentation centers. Flexibility and versatility are the first criteria under which the software has been developed. This flexibility is illustrated, for example, in the fact that, in principle, practically any bibliographic structure can be handled by the software. Similarly, non-bibliographical structures can be created as long as the information is mostly 'textual', this being a limitation that emerges from the database technology underlying the software, which is the textual database. (CDS/)ISIS. A good understanding of some basic ISIS-related concepts and techniques, eg the Formatting Language, is crucial for expert handling of the ABCD software. For this reason many sections of the documentation also deal with the underlying ISIS technology.

ABCD is called a library and documentation center software 'suite' because it is made up of relatively independent modules, which can cooperate with each other, but can also exist in isolation. In fact, already existing advanced software, which has shown its potential in demanding environments such as BIREME applications (within the context of the Virtual Health Library), have been adopted and adapted in ABCD - and this is the reason why which their original names, such as iAH, SeCS (both developed by Bireme) and EmpWeb (Web loans) originally developed by KALIO ltda. from Uruguay and widely tested in Chile) are maintained. These main components are displayed, with their hierarchical relationships, on the second level,

## Central ABCD

**The Central** component of ABCD includes modules for Database Administration (database creation, structure editing, utilities), Cataloging, Acquisitions, Circulation/Loans and Statistics. A Thesaurus Management module is also being prepared as part of the cataloging module, for a specific database with a thesaurus structure with consistent control of hierarchical levels. **As part of this core** modulewe can also mention import and export services, printing and database administration tools such as blocking/unblocking and making global changes to the fields of the records. If the (new) 'Document Supply' and 'Digital Library' modules are installed, the librarian or system administrator can also provide responses to requests for digital information and documents. In fact, any database can be fully managed (editing, searching, presentation...) from this central 'hub'. This 'Central' module, in fact, represents the 'back-office' component of ABCD,


Any ISIS database structure can be defined and managed in ABCD, with records whose current length is 1MB with a maximum of 4Gb for the database size (but these restrictions will become obsolete in the next NBP-based generation of ISIS and ABCD). Compared to 'normal' ISIS technology, 60-character indexing keys are used, (instead of 30-character keys) which gives greater strength in the control of authority lists and thesaurus through the definition of very flexible validation formats at the time of data entry. All interaction is based on WWW technology allowing, for example, HTML-encoded character strings for full text entry, indexing, hyperlinks to help pages, etc.


## The OPAC of ABCD (iAH)


The public search interface (OPAC) is an adapted version of BIREME's general 'advanced interface for Health information' (iAH). It has all the 'classic' elements of online database searching through either a very simple 'Google'-like interface or more advanced ways of searching with field-selectors and Boolean operators. The iAH interface developed by BIREME is currently being upgraded to iAHx, ensuring it will align perfectly with modern Information Retrieval concepts and techniques (eg clustering, relevance ranking based on Lucene indexing). the ABCD Site


The search function is offered as part of an 'end-users' portal page, presenting the own catalog(s) in a much wider information context by providing access to other information resources (eg Google, Medline...) and communication (announcements, alerts), also paving the way for 'Web 2.0'-like functions. It allows meta-searches on not only the local catalogs but also many other information resources. A link to the dedicated OPAC's for each resource is also available.


The Site Administrator is currently a specific Content Management System, which allows designing the structure and components of the ABCD portal pages.


## The ABCD Serials Control System (SeCS)

This module offers an advanced management tool for serials/journals (classical and/or electronic) of any publication type (referring to periodicity). Serials as such but also issues of a serial and all types of publication patterns can be managed by this module. BIREME uses this technology eg for its products 'Portal of Scientific Journals' (see : http://portal.revistas.bvs.br/main.php?home=true&lang=en ) and SCAD (see : [http://scad. bvs.br/php/index.php?lang=en](http://scad.bvs.br/php/index.php?lang=en) ) which is the Brazilian union catalog of over 12,000 journals (with millions of issues) of more than 50 libraries.


## ABCD's Advanced Loan System (EmpWeb)

This module offers advanced loan management with some options and features geared towards larger and more complex organizations. It provides a 'MyLibrary' function for end users, through the OPAC based on 'web-services' technology. It can be used to replace the built-in ABCD lending module in case you need to meet the needs of multiple lending policies as well as high volume transaction situations.

The idea of a 'suite' reflects the fact that ABCD has relatively independent parts, just like the office automation suite (eg Open Office, Microsoft Office) - but with obvious cooperative links. For example, the Statistics module, a component of the Circulation and Loans module, can work with any ISIS database, while the IAH-OPAC also offers information retrieval procedures, based on web technology, on any set of ISIS databases, not just those maintained under ABCD. The Serials Control System (SeCS) manages ISIS databases for serials inside or outside the context of ABCD. But we believe that together these parts make up a very powerful 'suite' of tools
