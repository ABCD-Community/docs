  **Booking**

  - Now it is allowed to reserve if there are copies available but all are reserved
  - It is allowed to assign a format to present the reservations from the iAH. This format must be named **opac_reserve.pft** and must be accompanied by the corresponding **opac_reserve_h.txt** to place the column titles. Example:

  ```
    opac_reserve.pft:
    
     v15' - 'v20'|', /*BD and Object Control No.*/
     '#REFER#','|' /*To insert the data of the object*/
     v30*6.2,"/"v30*4.2,"/"v30.4,' 'v31, ' 'v32,'|' /* Date, time and operator that reserves */
     if v1='0' or v1='3' then
        if p(v40) and v40<mid(date,0,8) then,'<font color=red>' fi,
     fi, v60*6.2,"/"v60*4.2,"/"v60.4 '-', v40*6.2,"/"v40*4.2,"/"v40.4,
     '</font>|', /*Date from-to wait*/
     v130*6.2,"/"v130*4.2,"/"v130.4'|', /*Cancel Date*/
     v200*6.2,"/"v200*4.2,"/"v200.4,'|', /*Date the loan was processed*/
     v1/ /*Situation*/
     
  ```

  This format draws a table as output, where each column is delimited by the **|** . You can modify this format to suit your needs as long as you maintain the separation of the columns and add the line break **/** single to the end as this separates the retrieved records.

  To name the columns use the following file:

  ```
    opac_reserve_h.txt
  
    Control number
    Reference
    Reservation date and Operator
    waiting period
    cancellation date
    loan date
    Situation
  ```

  These columns must correspond to those generated in the **opac_reserve.pft format**

  Loan interface - iAH

  - The following messages were defined in the message table loan.tab

  |     message code     |                           Used in                            |
  | :------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
  | iah_user_reservation | It appears in a window that requests the user code to process a reservation |
  |    iah_user_ecta     | It is presented in the window that requests the user code to process the account statement |
  |      opac_ecta       | It is presented in the window that shows the user's account status |
  |       rsvr_hlp       | It is presented in the window that shows the result of a ticket reservation request |

  ## Changes to 02-06-2015

  An option identified as **Help tooltips on the database fields** was implemented in the **Update database definition** menu, which allows defining the help on the database fields in the form of a box with pop-up text (tooltip ). (see [Tooltips on database fields](http://abcdwiki.net/Ayudas_emergentes_sobre_los_campos_de_la_base_de_datos) )

  The option that allows searches in the system operators database was implemented. See [Searches by name in the operators database](http://abcdwiki.net/Búsquedas_por_nombre_en_la_base_de_datos_de_operadores) .

  The footer of the ABCD windows was modified to show the date of the update of the current version

  An option to prevent the database from being initialized or deleted has been implemented in the maintenance menu (see [Protecting the database](http://abcdwiki.net/Proteger_la_base_de_datos) ) .

  Online account statement consultation from the iAH was implemented (see [Online account statement](http://abcdwiki.net/wiki/es/index.php?title=IAH_Consultar_el_estado_de_cuenta_de_un_usuario) ). Online renewal is also allowed (see [Online Renewal](http://abcdwiki.net/wiki/es/index.php?title=IAH_Estado_de_cuenta) ).

  Online booking implemented (see Online [booking](http://abcdwiki.net/wiki/es/index.php?title=IAH_Reserva_en_línea) )

  Fixed a reported issue with editing repeatable fields in unmarked format databases

  [New database compatible with the reservation process (reserve) (Only updated in Spanish)](http://www.abcdwiki.net/download/1.4_20141008/reserve.zip)

  [Modifications to the definition of the transaction database (trans) (Only updated in Spanish)](http://www.abcdwiki.net/download/1.4_20141008/trans.zip)

  

  ## Changes as of 11/07/2014

  (Updated central.zip, 00.zip and config_extended.zip files)

  - Added the option to search in the cataloging module through a thesaurus (see [ [Thesaurus](http://abcdwiki.net/wiki/es/index.php?title=Tesauros) ]
  - Problem with the calculation of the copies available at the time of reservation was corrected to take into account those cases in which the policy does not allow reserving a copy
  - An option was added to access the history of the searches carried out on each database during a session (see: [Search history])

  ## Changes as of 08/10/2014

  ### Setting

  - Added the possibility of having a different appearance of the interface (colors, fonts, etc) and logo for each of the **base** folders defined in the system (see [Change of appearance](http://abcdwiki.net/wiki/es/index.php?title=Cambiar_la_apariencia_(colores_y/o_iconos)_utilizados_en_la_interfaz_de_una_carpeta_de_bases_de_datos) ) .

  - Added a new parameter to the abcd.def file:

  ```
     reserve=N
  ```

  

  ### Cataloging

  - All scripts were checked because there were problems when the wxis was called by the Post method

  - The possibility of generating a javascript is being added to validate the entry before sending the data to the server. To do this, 3 columns were added to the FDT: Mandatory, type of field, and input pattern. Do not use yet because it is under development

  - Fixed problem with Z39.50 import when using a conversion table

  - In the display window of the records from a search, the search expression is shown in a hidden division which can be displayed by clicking on the corresponding link. Also added an option to refine the query results

  - Revised mfn positioning when switching from search display to Mfn display. Now keeps the mfn of the last record presented in the search and allows a sequential review from that Mfn

  - The copy of the registry was reviewed by search and assignment of the control number and it works correctly

  - When copying a record, it does not pass the operator field data and last update date

  - Record creation date field and operator is now set to readonly

  - Fixed problem with display of default values

  - Now the breakdown of field 08 is presented correctly when editing default values

  

  ### Utility

  - Changed inverted list update via MX (see [Updating inverted list using mx](http://abcdwiki.net/wiki/es/index.php?title=Actualización_de_la_lista_invertida_utilizando_el_MX) )

  ### Circulation

  - All scripts were checked because there were problems when the wxis was called by the post method

  - Added option to work with union catalogs when the copies database is not used. In this case, each library has its own field for entering the holdings in the cataloging record and ABCD is in charge of selecting which holdings are shown to the operator, both in cataloging and in loans. This process is in testing and will be thoroughly documented later.

  - The presentation formats used in the "State of an item" processes and the display of reserves in the processes of current loan can be configured by the user (see: [Change display](http://abcdwiki.net/wiki/es/index.php?title=Cambiar_despliegue) ) .

  - In the presentation of the reservations of a title, the reservations on hold are presented first and then the rest of the reservations registered for that title.

  - At the time of lending, a field was activated to request additional information about the loan. For it:

  1. Added field 300 in the trans FDT
  2. Modified the loan receipt formats (r_loan.pft, r_return.pft, ...) in the trans/pfts folder to add the 300 field
  3. The format for table presentation of transactions (tbtrans.pft) in the trans/pfts folder was modified
  4. Presentation format of the transactions in the account statement (trans.pft) in the folder trans/pfts
  5. The display format of transactions in the status of an item (loans_display.pft) in the trans/pfts folder was modified

  - Fixed loan span when item is reserved. Now takes the value set in the policy

  - A script was enabled to do an advanced search in the "Status of an item" option. Also in the menu

  "Update database definition" an option was added to specify the advanced search form to be used in the reservation processes and in the item status. The fields that appear in this advanced search form can be fixed through an option in the **Update a database definition menu.**

  - Created the scripts_circulation.php script to place the javascripts that need to be called in the lending module

  - Fixed problem that occurred in Internet Explorer that did not allow printing of loan or return receipts

  - To disable a user in loans, put as effective date a date less than the current date.

  ### Bookings

  - Changed the reservation presentation formats: tbreserve and reserve_01.pft to facilitate the presentation of the icons that allow you to cancel, print and send by mail the information of a reservation

  - In the presentation of the reservation lists, an option was added that allows deleting all the records of a category (reservations attended, reservations cancelled, pending reservations, etc.)

  - The display of reserves in the current loan processes can be configured by the user (see: [Change display](http://abcdwiki.net/wiki/es/index.php?title=Cambiar_despliegue) )

  

  ## Updates to 06/25/2014

  ### cataloging

  - Fixed existing problem with default values

  - Additional parameters have been added to the [dr_path.def](http://abcdwiki.net/Dr_path.def) file that allow overriding some parameters set in the initial configuration file **config.php** and that have to do with the reading and processing mode of a particular database. **For this purpose, the config_extended.php** script was created, which allows extending the **config.php** with new parameters without the need to replace the existing **config.php** , thus losing the already established local configuration. To enable the use of **config_extended.php make the following change to the** **config.php** script

  ```
     if (isset($arrHttp["base"])){
  	if (isset($def[$arrHttp["base"]]))
   		$cisis_ver=$def[$arrHttp["base"]],"/";
     }
     
     //***
     //Include config_extended.php that reads configuration parameters that applies to the selected database
     if (file_exists(realpath(dirname(__FILE__)).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR."config_extended.php"))
  	  include (realpath(dirname(__FILE__)).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR."config_extended.php");
     //***
  ```

  

  - Fixed display problem of repeatable fields in default values

  ### circulation and loans

  - The script usuarios_prestamos_presentar.php was modified **to** make a single call to wxis.exe to update the loan (trans), reserve (reserve) and transaction log (logtrans) databases. Also for these purposes, the wxis/crear_registro.xis script was updated
  - In the loans with copies option, when configuring a source database, the **loans.dat file was written incorrectly**
  - Wasn't accepting $ in local currency code settings
  - In the "database with copies" mode, it did not present the "situation of an object" when the inventory number did not exist in "loanobjects" but did exist in **copies**

  ### Bookings

  - Several adjustments were made to the reservation module, including changes in the database definition, the procedure to assign to a reservation when a copy of the reserved title is returned, mailing to participate in the reservation assignment, among others. For more information, see [Requirements to implement the reservation](http://abcdwiki.net/Requisitos_para_implementar_la_reserva) . **The reserve** folder is included with the database definition files. The def and pfts folders have not been translated to all languages
  - **You must include the reserve** database in the bases.dat **file** to be able to maintain it from the cataloging module

  ### iAH configuration

  - Fixed the option to delete lines in the edition of the .DEF file

  ### Z39.50

  - Changed writing a record since Z39.50 to make it compatible with the new database update methodology (<tag 0> ... </tag>)

  ### internationalization

  - Added new messages to the Loans and Cataloging messaging.

  # Version 1.3t (09/12/2013)

  ## Discharge

  [index.php (index.rar)](http://www.abcdwiki.net/download/index.rar)

  [config.php (config.rar)](http://www.abcdwiki.net/download/config.rar)

  [Central folder Version 1.3t (central.rar)](http://www.abcdwiki.net/download/1.3/central.rar) Includes the adjustments made to correct the update problem that was generated with Linux Ubuntu

  [message files](http://www.abcdwiki.net/download/lang.rar)

  [reservations database](http://www.abcdwiki.net/download/reserve.rar)

  ## Change Log

  **New Wiki** (under construction)

  

  ### index.php

  

  ### config.php

  - A new parameter is included to set the date and time zone. On some servers, the lack of this parameter can cause an error of the type "warning"

  ```
     $date_default_timezone_set('America/Caracas');
  ```

  

  - A new parameter is included to condition whether abcd operators can change their access keys

  ```
     $change_password="Y";
  ```

  

  - A new parameter is included to define the file types that can be uploaded by the operators during the cataloging process. It is indicated as follows:

  ```
  $ext_allowed=array("jpg","gif","png","pdf","doc","docx","xls","xlsx","odt");
  ```

  

  ```
   $ext_allowed=array("jpg","gif","png","pdf","doc","docx","xls","xlsx","odt");
  ```

  

  - If you are working with multiple database folders, the $ **msg_path** parameter is created to be able to have a single message folder and not have to replicate it in all the base folders. $msg_path will be the path to the message files. Example:

  ```
  $msg_path="/abcd/www/bases/";
  ```

  

  **Important note:** if you copy the new config.php file, make sure to modify the parameters that refer to the paths and execution modes on your machine. If you don't want to copy the config.php include in yours the parameters **$ext_allowed** , **$msg_path** and **$change_password** with the corresponding values. In this distribution of the config.php the wxis.exe is called by the EXEC method and not by using the POST method (see $Wxis and $wxisUrl parameters in [config.php](http://abcdwiki.net/wiki/es/index.php?title=Configuración_inicial_(config.php))

  ### Definition of databases

  - A new **Link to FDT** column was implemented which is applied to input sheets to keep the input sheet field linked to the field description in the FDT so that changes made to the FDT are inherited by the entry sheets. This binding works only at the field level, whether or not they have subfields. Existing specifications in the entry sheet will be ignored and replaced by field specifications in the FDT

  - New forms were implemented to present the input formats in the cataloging procedure (see [Types of fields](http://isisabcd.pbworks.com/w/page/30994600/Tipos de campos) ). To avoid problems with the previous definitions, ABCD will take care of making the changes internally until the Administrator edits and saves the FDT and Entry Formats again.

  ### Operator permissions

  

  

  ### cataloging

  - Main Entry Index

  

  - Default values

  

  - Uppercase subfields

  

  - Edit search expression

  

  - javascript errors

  

  - Cross searches in output formats

  

  - Activation of special reports

  

  - Global Changes

  

  

  - Record Import
    - Added new options to record import to allow **Remove Carriage Return** (when the iso comes from Windows and the import will be done under Linux). This option is done by generating a temporary copy of the iso file on the server, which is processed with the Linux **tr command.** If the operating system where the import is to be performed is Windows, using this option will produce an error.
    - Convert from ASCII to ANSI (when the iso comes from WinIsis or IsisDos) To do this, the import is done with **MX** using the option **convert=ANSI** (see [Import ISO file](http://isisabcd.pbworks.com/w/page/69748641/Importar archivo ISO) )

  ### utility

  - Generation of the inverted list with the MX

  

  ### iAH

  - **The way to present the databases coming from several base** folders in the iAH was documented (see [Integrating the consultation of databases coming from several base folders in a single ABCD-SITE](http://abcdwiki.net/Integrar_en_un_solo_ABCD-SITE_la_consulta_de_bases_de_datos_provenientes_de_varias_carpetas_bases) ) .
  - The way to have several ABCD-SITES was documented when the installation has its databases distributed in several **base** folders and each folder needs to have its own site (see [Publishing several ABCD-Sites under the same ABCD installation](http://abcdwiki.net/Publicar_varios_ABCD-Site_bajo_una_misma_instalación_de_ABCD) ) .

  ### circulation and loans

  - Changes were made to the definition of the reserve database to conform to the procedure. These definitions are only in Spanish, so it is necessary to generate the folders and formats for the different languages (see [Reserve Database (reserve)](http://isisabcd.pbworks.com/w/page/69976027/Configuración y archivos necesarios) )
  - An option was defined that initializes the transaction (trans), suspension and fine (suspml) and reservation (reserve) databases. This option is found in the Main Circulation Menu -> Administration -> Initialize transaction database
  - Adjustments were made to the procedure for borrowing without the database copies
  - Adjustments were made to the loan procedure with the copies database
  - Added the option to create and process reservations from the loan counter
  - Added an option to design special reports in the loan module (see [Configuring loan reports](http://isisabcd.pbworks.com/w/page/67011510/Configuración de los reportes de préstamo) )
  - Added an option to produce special loan reports (Transactions -> Reports)
  - Changed the trans database loans_display.pft format to add a new field at the end
