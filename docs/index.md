###### ABCD Knowledge base

ABCD (Automation of Libraries and Documentation Center's, from its name in Spanish and Portuguese) is a multilingual, Open Source, Web application for the management of libraries It contains core library functions such as cataloging, lending, acquisitions and database administration.

ABCD was initially developed by [Bireme](http://wiki.bireme.org/en/index.php/Main_Page) with the support of [VLIR/UOS](https://www.vliruos.be) and many people from different institutions and countries. Currently the development is solely done by volunteers in several countries but not enough thanks can be given to G. Ascencio and E. Spinak.


ABCD is based on [[ISIS-technology](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/information-society/open-source-and-low-cost-technologies/information-processing-tools/cdsisis-database-software/UNESCO-supported)].
